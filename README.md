# Password-Generator-Feb-2021

## Functional Password Generator

In this project, I was commissioned to set up a password generator, using Prompt windows.  The password also needed to inculed options for upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. This was a extremely difficult challenge for me.  While I understand the concepts of how JavaScript is layed out, I did not have a full understanding of how it held values to be used for later.  It was these concepts and had to learn outside of class, probably spending a total of 30-40 hours on this project.

### Code

In this project the HTML and CSS were given and I was required to build on the JavaScript file that was provided.

### My biggest hurdles

I had to take my pseudocoding down to the most basic functions, to really understand how this project would work.  I started and scratched so many different ideas because I did not understand what was going on with the structure of the JavaScript.  What I mean by that is I understand how to add eventlistners, and I understood how to ask questions with Java what I could not figure out is how the values were stored.  I knew that they would need to be called but did not understand where to call from.  It was once I figured this out that I was even able to begin on this project.  I used console.log throughout the whole project to help myself understand that the Java was holding the values.  I still could not figure out the math, and this was extremely frustrating, but I will continue to study and understand until I get it.

UTSA coding school, for writing the code for me to work on.
